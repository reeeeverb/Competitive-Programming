## Mathematics
- it exists and everyone hates it this page just mentions the most useful fns that will be revisted

#### Sum Formulas 
- ∑x<sup>k</sup> -- Where k is a positive integer there exists a formula to calculate the sum (Faulhaber's formula)
	- for ∑x<sup>1</sup>  $\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$
	- for ∑x<sup>2</sup> = $\frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}$
- **Arithmetic progressions** is a sequene of numbers where the difference between any 2 numbers is constant 
	- ie 3,7,11,15 // constant 4
	- the sum of an arithmetic progression from a...b with constant n =  $\frac{n(a+b)}{2}$
		- $\frac{4(3+15)}{2}$ = 36
- **Geometric Progressions** is a sequence of numbers where the ratio between any two consecutive numbers is constant 
	- ie 3,6,12,24 with constant 2 
	- the sum where b is the last number, a is the first and is the ratio is calculated as $\frac{bk-a}{k-1}$
		- $\frac{24*2-3}{2-1} = 45$
- **Harmonic Sum** is a sum of the form ∑ $\frac{1}{x}$ = 1+$\frac{1}{2}$+$\frac{1}{3}$+...$\frac{1}{n}$
	- We can estimate this sum by rounding each term 1/k such that k is the nearest power of two that does not exceed k 
	- when n = 6 the parts become (1, 2 * 1/2, 3 * 1/4, etc) where each part is at most 1   

#### Set Theory 
- a **set** is a collection of elements, for example X={2,4,7}
	- |X| indicates the size of set X == 3
- **Operations**
	- the *intersection* of a set consists of elements that are in both sets A and B 
	- the *Union* of a set consists of that are in A or B or Both 
	- the *Complement* of a set consists of elements that are not in A but are in the universal set that constains all possible elements 
	- the *difference* between 2 sets consists of elements that are in A but not in B
- If each element of A also belongs to set S we say that A is a *subset* of S
	- every set has $2^{|S|}$ subsets including the empty set
