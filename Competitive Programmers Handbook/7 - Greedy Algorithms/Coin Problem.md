- a **greedy algo** constructs a solution by always making a choice that looks the best at the moment 
	- highly efficent but will not always result in an optimal solution 

#### Coin Problem 
- We are given a set of coins and our task to to form a sum of money n using the coins, what is the minimum number of coins needed?
- In this instance a greedy algo would select the largest possible coin until the required sum of money has been constructed 
	- this will always work in cases where each coin is a multiple of the largest possible coin 
	- this is not true in the general case however
