## Scheduling Problem
- many scheduling problems can be solved using greedy algos, such as the classic problem

- given n events with their starting and ending times find a schedule that includes as many events as possible, it is not possible to paritally select an event
- there are many different impementations of greedy algos in this case:
	- Shortest time first (doesn't work in many cases)
	- Starting time first (doesn't work in many cases)
	- Ending time (Optimal)
