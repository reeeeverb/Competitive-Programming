## Calculation Rules

#### Loops
- Loops are the reason why most algos. time complexity is rat shit 
	- If there are $n^k$ nested loops the time complexity is $O(n^k)$ 
- when calculating time complexity only the order of magnitude is used 
	- regardless of how many times that loop is executed that loop adds 1 magnitude to the time complexity of the algo

#### Phases
- If an algo consists of multiple phases where nested loops are utilized then the time complexity is the largest order of magnitude of these phases 
	- this is because that phase is the bottleneck for the execution of the algo
